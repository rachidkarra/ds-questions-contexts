Popular implementations of SQL commonly omit support for basic features of Standard SQL, such as the DATE or TIME data types. The most obvious such examples, and incidentally the most popular commercial and proprietary SQL DBMSs, are . Oracle whose DATE behaves as DATETIME,[26][27] and lacks a TIME type . and MS SQL Server (before the 2008 version). In the relational model of databases, a primary key is a specific choice of a minimal set of attributes (columns) that uniquely specify a tuple (row) in a relation (table).[a][1] Informally, a primary key is which attributes identify a record, and in simple cases constitute a single attribute: a unique ID. More formally, a primary key is a choice of candidate key (a minimal superkey); any other candidate key is an alternate key. A primary key may consist of real-world observables, in which case it is called a natural key, while an attribute created to function as a key and not used for identification outside the database is called a surrogate key. For example, for a database of people (of a given nationality), time and location of birth could be a natural key.[b] National identification number is another example of an attribute that may be used as a natural key. .

Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. Python tuples are a data structure that store an ordered sequence of values. Tuples are immutable. This means you cannot change the values in a tuple. Tuples are defined with parenthesis.  Python's built-in (or standard) data types can be grouped into several classes. Sticking to the hierarchy scheme used in the official . Python documentation these are numeric types, sequences, sets and mappings . (and a few more not discussed further here). Some of the types are only available in certain versions of the language as noted below.",

Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick. Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.. Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that python 3 is not completely backward-compatible. Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.",
