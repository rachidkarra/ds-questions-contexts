SQL offers two main advantages over older read\u2013write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.  Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus. SQL types of statements are classed as sublanguages. SQL consists of many types of statements commonly: DQL, DDL, DCL and DML. a data control language (DCL). a data manipulation language (DML). The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.

        "Context": "SQL is the abbreviation for Structured query language. A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. It is used to merge two tables or retrieve data from there. A view is a virtual table which consists of a subset of data contained in a table. It can have data of one or more tables combined and it depends on the relationship. Since views are not present, it takes less space to store. . A table refers to a collection of data in an organised manner in form of rows and columns. A field refers to the number of columns in a table. Firstly, SQL introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. BETWEEN operator is used to display rows based on a range of values in a row  whereas the IN condition operator is used to check for values contained in a specific set of values. Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the Customers table consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table. Entities:  A person, place, or thing in the real world about which data can be stored in a database. Tables store data that represents one type of entity. For example \u2013 A bank database has a customer table to store customer information. The customer table stores this information as a set of attributes (columns within the table) for each customer.",

Popular implementations of SQL commonly omit support for basic features of Standard SQL, such as the DATE or TIME data types. The most obvious such examples, and incidentally the most popular commercial and proprietary SQL DBMSs, are . Oracle whose DATE behaves as DATETIME,[26][27] and lacks a TIME type . and MS SQL Server (before the 2008 version). In the relational model of databases, a primary key is a specific choice of a minimal set of attributes (columns). primary key uniquely specify a tuple (row) in a relation (table).[a][1] A primary key is an attribute that identify uniquely a record. and in simple cases constitute a single attribute: a unique ID. More formally, a primary key is a choice of candidate key (a minimal superkey). any other candidate key is an alternate key. A primary key may consist of real-world observables, in which case it is called a natural key, while an attribute created to function as a key and not used for identification outside the database is called a surrogate key. For example, for a database of people (of a given nationality), time and location of birth could be a natural key.[b] National identification number is another example of an attribute that may be used as a natural key. . SQL statements can also be compiled and stored in remote RDBs as packages and then invoked by package name. Packaging and invoke package name are  important for the efficient operation. of application programs. that issue complex, high-frequency queries. it is especially important when the tables to be accessed are located in remote systems.",

        "Context": "As a scripting language with modular architecture, simple syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing. Libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing. [182][183] with specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. Comments can be used to explain Python code. Comments can be used to make the code more readable and can be used to prevent execution when testing code. Comments starts with a # and Python will ignore them. Python is commonly used in artificial intelligence projects and machine learning projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch and Scikit-learn. Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache web server. The Python analogue of null pointer known from other programming languages is None. None is not a null pointer or a null reference but an actual object of which there is only one instance. One of the uses of None is in default argument values of functions ",

        "Context": "Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick. Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.. Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that python 3 is not completely backward-compatible. Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.",
