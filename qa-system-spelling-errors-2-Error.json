It is used to merge two tables or retrieve data from there. A view is a virtual table which consists of a subset of data contained in a table. It can have data of one or more tables combined and it depends on the relationship. Since views are not present, it takes less space to store. . A table refers to a collection of data in an organised manner in form of rows and columns. A field refers to the number of columns in a table. Firstly, SQL introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. BETWEEN operator is used to display rows based on a range of values in a row  whereas the IN condition operator is used to check for values contained in a specific set of values. Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the Customers table consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table. Entities:  A person, place, or thing in the real world about which data can be stored in a database. Tables store data that represents one type of entity. For example \u2013 A bank database has a customer table to store customer information. The customer table stores this information as a set of attributes (columns within the table) for each customer.",
